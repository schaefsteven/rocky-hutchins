Technologies used: 
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

## Features
Some notable features of the site include: 

### Web Scraping of Bandcamp and Youtube
The music page of the site pulls its data from Bandcamp and Youtube. Adding one of these items to the page is as simple as copy-and-pasting the link into the CMS. Hugo then fetches the page from Bandcamp or Youtube and pulls out all of the information that we need such as the album art, the video and album IDs for embedded players, etc.
